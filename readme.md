This repository contains the lecture notes and exams (with solutions) for a course I taught in Fall 2011. The topics covered were

* Structural induction (notably induction over trees)
* Finite state automata
    * semigroups, monoids, free monoids
    * Kleene closure
    * regular expressions
    * deterministic automata
    * accessible and inaccessible states
    * nondeterministic automata
    * Îµ-topology on the state set
    * theorem that tfae as far as recognizing a language goes:
        * (nondeterministic | generalized | plain old) finite state automaton
        * regular expression
    * Myhill-Nerode theorem characterizing regular languages
    * pumping lemma
* Groups and Monoids
    * ideals in monoids
    * ascending chain condition
    * congruences, quotients, and the associated universal mapping property
    * presentations by generators and relations
    * Tietze transformations
    * theorem that any two group presentations are related by Tietze transformations
    * van Kampen diagrams
    * classification of groups of order 8
    * presentation of the symmetric groups
* Rewriting systems and the Knuth-Bendix theorem
    * decision problems in general and the word problem in particular
    * linear orderings, well orderings, lexicographic order,
    * translation invariant orderings, reduction orderings
    * canonical forms
    * rewrite rules, rewrite systems
    * algorithm for rewriting of words wrt a rewrite system
    * Church-Rosser property
    * confluent and locally confluent rewrite systems
    * for reduction orderings tfae: Church-Rosser, confluence, local confluence
    * algorithm to test if a rewrite system is confluent
    * the Knuth-Bendix algorithm to produce a reduced, confluent rewriting system
    * conclusion: if the Knuth-Bendix algorithm terminates then we can solve the word problem for the monoid in question
